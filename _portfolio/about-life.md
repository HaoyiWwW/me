Welcome to 'Life', a canvas broad and bright,
A gallery of moments, captured in the light.
From corners of the globe, where my lens takes flight,
To the cozy nook at home, where my hamster delights.

Novels that have touched me, in the quiet of the night,
Paintings I've created, in the morning's first light.
This space is a testament, to life's infinite sight,
A kaleidoscope of hobbies, a beacon burning bright.
