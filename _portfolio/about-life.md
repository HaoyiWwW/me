Welcome to 'Life', a canvas broad and bright,<br>
A gallery of moments, captured in the light.<br>
From corners of the globe, where my lens takes flight,<br>
To the cozy nook at home, where my hamster delights.<br>

Novels that have touched me, in the quiet of the night,<br>
Paintings I've created, in the morning's first light.<br>
This space is a testament, to life's infinite sight,<br>
A kaleidoscope of hobbies, a beacon burning bright.<br>
