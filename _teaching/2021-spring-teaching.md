From 2021 January - 2021 May, as a graduate instructor, I:
• Taught two sections of MATH124 Finite Mathematics online to 60 students through Zoom, which covered topics such as logic, sets, probability, matrices, linear programming, etc.
• Designed and developed weekly exams and homework problem sets on Moodle, which assessed students’ understanding and application of the course concepts and skills.
• Provided timely and constructive feedback and support to students through email, office hours, and discussion forums.
• Achieved high scores and positive reviews from students on their course evaluation and satisfaction.
