👩‍💻  I'm a graduate student studying Computer and Information Technology at UPenn.

📚  Ed.M. in Human Development and Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education <br>
📚  B.A. in Mathematics, Carleton College

🔬  How do human beings acquire the ability to do mathematics? <br>
    My research interests include mathematical cognition and mathematical problem-solving. In particular, I am intellectually curious about the abstraction of mathematical structures, psychological and conative factors that explain individual differences in mathematical competence, and the broader social context of mathematical learning. <br>
    Through the analysis of data both in and out of classrooms, my research aims to contribute to learning designs and bridge the gap between theory and practice.

📣  Currently, I am actively looking for summer research opportunities in Mathematics Education.
