👩‍💻  I'm a first-year graduate student studying Computer and Information Technology at UPenn.

📚  Ed.M. in Human Development and Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education <br>
    B.A. in Mathematics, Carleton College

🔬  What affect people's learning of math? <br>
    My research interests include mathematics education. In particular, I am intellectually curious about covariances and predictors of efficient mathematical problem-solving. <br>
    My current favorite technique involves usage of structural equation modeling in testing hypotheses about causal effects among observed or proxies for latent variables, especially in model generation. <br>
    From analyzing data in everyday classrooms, I intend to contribute to the design of technology interventions as well as bridging the gap between theory and practice.

📣  Currently, I am actively looking for summer research opportunities in Mathematics Education and Educational Technology.
