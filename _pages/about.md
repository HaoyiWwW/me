👩‍💻  I'm a first-year graduate student studying Computer and Information Technology at UPenn.

📚  Ed.M. in Human Development and Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education <br>
    B.A. in Mathematics, Carleton College

🔬  How do people learn math? <br>
    My research interest lies in the intersection of mathematics, education, and technology. Specifically, I am interested in exploring factors influencing math learning and teaching and designing accessible ITS for everyday classrooms to help students acquire math problem-solving skills.

📣  Currently, I am actively looking for summer research opportunities in Mathematics Education and Educational Technology.
